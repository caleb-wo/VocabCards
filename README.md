# Overview

This software was written with java. The build tool that I used was Maven. It is meant to show my proficiency with Java. 

I use Enums, Builder classes, and a Singleton. Additionally, I used project Lombok to help me with boilerplate code. I also made an effort to hard code as well to show my ability.

This app acts as a vocab trainer. It's meant for me to use to grow my understanding of STEM topics.


(_NOTE:_ you'll notice my .env file is pushed to github. This is by design as it is set up with relative paths. This ensures that it will work on anyone's machine.)

# Development Environment

I used Maven as my build tool and also utilize project Lombok. I used @Getter, @Setter, and @Builder. I also used dotenv-java (see pom file). That way I was able to use a .env file similar to node.
